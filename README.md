## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro + dominguez-morata project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
.
├── public/open

│   ├── content/empty
│   │   └── docs/empty

Dom-Mor looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory. Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Images can be added to `src/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.

Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `public/` directory.
